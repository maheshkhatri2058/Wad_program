🚀 Just launched my latest project – a Quiz Web App built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js (Express) backend hosted on Render!
Frontend is live on Vercel 🎯

👨‍💻 What it does:

Presents timed quizzes to users

Automatically submits when time is up ⏳

Stores and sends user info & score to the backend

Clean UI using Tailwind CSS

Fully functional API integration using Axios

🔧 Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Axios

Backend: Node.js + Express (deployed on Render)

Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)

💡Things I learned:

Handling CORS issues in production 😅

Using import.meta.env for environment variables

Debugging 502/404/400 HTTP errors (fun times!)

Setting up auto form submission via timer

Huge thanks to the amazing dev community and tools like Postman & Vercel for making the process smoother.

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions! 😊
